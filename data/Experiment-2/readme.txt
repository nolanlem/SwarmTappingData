This zip file contains the following data from the paper "Individual differences of limitation to extract beat from Kuramoto coupled oscillators: transition from beat-based tapping to frequent tapping with weaker coupling" for Experiment 2. 

The stimuli used in the experiment is contained in the 'stimuli' directory and the data files that contain all of the oscillator zeros crossings are found in the 'stim-data' directory as .npy files. 

The tap responses of the participants are contained in the .csv files in the 'tap-data' directory.

The main scripts used for data processing is contained within the data-analysis-exp2.py file.
